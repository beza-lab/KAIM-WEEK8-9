Task 2 - Model Building and Training 
Data Preparation:
Feature and Target Separation [‘Class’(creditcard), ‘class’(Fraud_Data)]
Train-Test Split 
Model Selection
Use several models to compare performance, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Model Training and Evaluation
Training models for both credit card and fraud-data datasets.
MLOps Steps
Versioning and Experiment Tracking
Use tools like MLflow to track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and version models.

Task 3 - Model Explainability
Model explainability is crucial for understanding, trust, and debugging in machine learning models. You will use SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret the models you built for fraud detection.
Using SHAP for Explainability
SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance, explaining the contribution of each feature to the prediction.
Installing SHAP
pip install shap
Explaining a Model with SHAP
SHAP Plots
Summary Plot: Provides an overview of the most important features.
Force Plot: Visualizes the contribution of features for a single prediction.
Dependence Plot: This shows the relationship between a feature and the model output.
Using LIME for Explainability
LIME explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model.
Installing LIME
pip install lime
Explaining a Model with LIME
LIME Plots
Feature Importance Plot: Shows the most influential features for a specific prediction.
